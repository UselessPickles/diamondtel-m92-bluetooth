## About the Phone

The DiamondTel Model 92 Portable Cellar Telephone is a hybrid transportable/mobile (mobile, as in, "car phone") manufactured by Mitsubishi in the early 1990's.

The phone used 1G analog cellular technology ([AMPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System)), which has been discontinued in US since 2008. As such, it is impossible to activate service for this phone. 

This phone is of particular interest to me because it was available as an [official accessory from Mitsubishi for my 1993 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4](https://www.3swiki.org/Accessory:_Cellular_Telephone).
