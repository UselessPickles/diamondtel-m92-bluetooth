# Bluetooth Adapter Hardware

This directory contains information about the hardware portion of the DiamondTel Model 92 Bluetooth adapter.

NOTE: The Bluetooth Module, Microcontroller, and Telephone all have dedicated top-level directories with relevant technical information, datasheets, and much more. This directory focuses more on combining all the components together into the bluetooth adapter hardware.

## Basic Circuit Design

This is a simplified component diagram of the bluetooth adapter circuit. Many details of the circuit (power, ground, voltage biasing, supporting components, etc.) are omitted for clarity of understanding the big picture of how the major components interact with each other.
